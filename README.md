# Program Overview
The program basically takes an input and some of the words to its corresponding Gen-Z slang.

#Development
This is very much done but can still be improved and expanded.

## Reason

I initially thought of making a brainrot translator, then realized that there are a lot of words and I couldn't just copy and paste those word one by one. That is why I thought of webscraping, and since Im taking a python course I decided to use it here to improve my skills.
